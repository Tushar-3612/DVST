 
### 🏥 Project Name: Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

This project was created to analyze and understand data from the hospital's Emergency Room (ER). It helps the management see how the ER is performing, identify areas for improvement, and enhance the overall patient experience.

### 📂 Data Source

All the analysis is based on one data file:
* **File Name:** `Hospital ER_Data.csv`
* **What's inside:** This file contains patient information such as their age, gender, wait time, and satisfaction score. For a detailed description of each column, you can check the `Data Terminology.docx` file.

### 🎯 Main Goals of these Assignment 

The goal was to create a dashboard that could:
1.  Track daily key numbers like the total number of patients, average wait time, and average satisfaction score.
2.  Understand patient demographics (like age, gender, and race).
3.  Monitor which departments get the most referrals from the ER.
4.  Check the rate of ER patients being admitted to the hospital.

### 🛠️ Tool Used

* **Microsoft Power BI:** This tool was used for everything—connecting to the data, cleaning it, making calculations, and creating the final dashboard.

1.  **Monthly View:** A quick summary of the ER's performance for a selected month.
2.  **Consolidated View:** A combined view that lets you analyze data over a custom date range to see trends.
3.  **Patient Details:** A table view that shows detailed information for every single patient.
4.  **Key Takeaways:** A summary page that highlights the most important findings and suggestions from the analysis.
